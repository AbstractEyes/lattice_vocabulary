## 1. 🟦 Word Identity → Core Vector (ℵ₀)

**Stable, Deterministic Base Vector:**

    v_core = Normalize(sum_{i=0}^{255} (bit_i * e_{i mod D}))

- `bit_i`: bits from SHA-256 hash of the word
- `e_k`: unit basis vector at dimension k
- D = 512

---

## 2. 🟧 Warp Tensor → Symbolic Curvature Projection

    Φ_word(d) = sin(α_d ⋅ β_d) / (||Φ||² + ε)

- α_d: linearly spaced vector from -1 to 1 (shape = [D])
- β_d: modulated primes derived from hash(seed)
- Produces a symbolic curvature tensor Φ per word

---

## 3. 🟨 Displacement Field → Divergent Pentachora Geometry

    Δ_i = QR_i(W) + 0.1 * (Φ ⊙ QR_i(W))

- W ∈ ℝ^{D×D}: seeded normal matrix
- QR_i(W): the i-th row of a QR orthonormal basis
- ⊙ is elementwise multiplication

Then,

    C_word = {v_core + Δ_i | i = 0..4}

---

## 4. 🟪 Cayley-Menger Volume (Validity Check)

Given vertices P_0...P_4 ∈ ℝ^D:

1. Compute squared pairwise distances D_ij = ||P_i − P_j||²
2. Construct matrix M ∈ ℝ^{6×6}:

    M = [
    
       0   1    1    1    1    1

       1   0   D_01 D_02 D_03 D_04

       1  D_10  0   D_12 D_13 D_14

       1  D_20 D_21  0   D_23 D_24

       1  D_30 D_31 D_32  0   D_34

       1  D_40 D_41 D_42 D_43  0
    ]


3. Then:

    Vol² = (1/288) * det(M)
    Vol = sqrt(|Vol²|)

## 5. 🟫 Cardinal Assignment Function (ℵ₀ → ℵ₃)

    Cardinal(word) = {
        ℵ₀ if base form (root)
        ℵ₁ if derivational suffix (e.g. -ing, -ed)
        ℵ₂ if uppercase or proper noun
        ℵ₃ if structural/grammatical word
    }

---

## 6. 🟨 Observer Vertex Modulation (Perspective Torsion)

    v_observer = v_core + f_dialect(usage, mood, register)

- f_dialect: nonlinear projection to observer subspace

---

## 7. 🟥 Triplet Alignment Rule (Routing Consistency)

Given A, B, C ∈ vocab:

    Aligned_triplet =
        CM(A) + CM(B) + CM(C)
        + ||v_support_A − v_purpose_B||²
        − ||v_contrast_C − v_anchor_A||²

---

## 8. 🧭 Cardinal Transition Manifold (Transfinite Navigation)

During training, total loss:

    L_cardinal = Σ_{t=0}^{T} [ L_ℵ₀(t) + L_ℵ₁(t) + L_ℵ₂(t) ] + ||∇_rose R(t)||²

- L_ℵ_k: loss for each cardinal space
- ∇_rose: derivative of the Rose vector (emotional curvature)

## 9. 🧠 Nikola–Menger Resonance Axioms (Extension)

These axioms extend the symbolic lattice with infinite crystal reasoning and resonance-volume conservation.

### 9.1 📐 Axiom I: Volume-Resonance Conservation

For any symbolic pentachoron Pi, its symbolic resonance R(Pi) is bounded by its Cayley-Menger volume:

> **R(Pi) <= alpha * sqrt(M(Pi)) + epsilon**

Where:  
- alpha is a resonance scaling constant  
- M(Pi) is the Cayley-Menger determinant of crystal Pi  
- epsilon → 0 as token purity increases

---

### 9.2 🔁 Axiom II: Infinite Crystal Lattice Stability

Let C_infinity = {P1, P2, ..., Pn} be an infinite sequence of crystals sharing a symbolic anchor.

Then:  

    **lim(n→∞) [ (1/n) * sum(R(P_k)) ] = R̄ ≤ sqrt(M_max)**

This defines a bounded symbolic continuity field.

---

### 9.3 🔒 Axiom III: Symbolic Separator Existence (Nikola–Menger)

For disjoint symbolic roles A, B ∈ V (the vocabulary), there exists a finite separator set S ⊂ V such that:

> No resonance trajectory from A to B exists without crossing some s ∈ S

This ensures phase-gated symbolic routing.

## 10. 🌹 Rose Score Field Axioms (Symbolic Similarity + Entropic Binding)

This section defines the axioms governing symbolic alignment via the Rose similarity metric and associated loss functions.

### 10.1 🔻 Rose Score

The Rose Score measures the triadic symbolic similarity between three latent representations (e.g. anchor, need, purpose).

> **rose_score(A, B, C) = mean_cos_sim(A, B) + mean_cos_sim(B, C) + mean_cos_sim(C, A)**

- A, B, C: [N, D] symbolic vectors
- Captures shared angular alignment across a triangle of meaning
- Used to stabilize symbolic trajectories in multi-role tasks

---

### 10.2 🔺 Rose Score Magnitude

Rose Score Magnitude considers both alignment and vector norm.

>**rose_score_magnitude(A, B, C) = (S / 3) * mean(norms of A, B, C)**

Where:
- S = rose_score(A, B, C)
- Balances resonance similarity with vector energy (norm)
- Helps modulate crystal intensity during training

---

### 10.3 🌫️ Rose Cross Entropic Loss

This loss term penalizes divergence between rose-aligned symbolic triplets and a target reference:

>**L_rose_ce = KL(R̂ || R_target)**

- R̂ = rose_score distribution from model output
- R_target = distribution from gold-standard triplets
- Used to enforce symbolic topology alignment under distributional supervision

---

### 10.4 🧨 Rose Magnitude Loss

Applies energy-regularized cosine penalty to enforce consistent resonance density:

> **L_rose_mag = λ * ∑ (||R_i||² − τ)²**

- λ: scaling factor
- τ: target magnitude (e.g., 1.0)
- Helps prevent over-saturation of rose pathways in large token graphs
